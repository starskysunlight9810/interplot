Description: To analyze peak files in BED format, such as ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq, 
  it is often necessary to obtain intersection information among these peaks. 
  The get_combine_result() function enables the retrieval of all possible combinations 
  of input BED files and their intersections. Additionally, the get_beds() function 
  assists users in reading the desired files for intersection analysis. Once the 
  intersection results are calculated, the draw_venn() function can generate a 
  Venn plot to visualize the intersections, while the draw_upset() function provides 
  an upset plot for the intersection results. Furthermore, the draw_flowers() function 
  allows for the computation of merged information from the supplied BED files. 
  Lastly, the cal_pairwise() function can be used to generate a correlation plot of pairwise 
  intersections among the provided BED files.
